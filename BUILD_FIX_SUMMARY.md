# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Code and Missing Imports**
The IDE autofix had merged files incorrectly, causing:
- Duplicate export default functions
- Duplicate import statements
- Missing client component directives

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/quiz/[petType]/page.tsx` - Removed duplicate code and fixed imports
- `app/results/page.tsx` - Cleaned up duplicate content
- `app/about/page.tsx` - Removed duplicate export functions
- `app/breeds/page.tsx` - Cleaned up merged content
- `app/contact/page.tsx` - Fixed duplicate code

### 2. **JsonLdScript Component Issue**
The JsonLdScript component was defined in a utility file but needed to be a proper React component.

**Solution:**
- Created separate `components/seo/JsonLdScript.tsx` component
- Updated all imports to use the new component location
- Removed the component definition from `lib/seo/metadata.ts`

### 3. **Client Component Directive Missing**
The QuizStart component was using client-side hooks but missing the "use client" directive.

**Solution:**
- Added `'use client';` directive to `components/quiz/QuizStart.tsx`
